# Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn and practice Java programming. I will be uploading code snippets, exercises, and projects related to Java programming language, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) once I've completed the basic Java part.

## Getting Started

If you're new to this repository, here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-learning-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd java-learning-repo
   ```

3. Explore the folders to find code related to specific topics or projects.

## Java Basics

In this section, you will find code snippets and small projects that cover fundamental Java concepts. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Java programming.

- **HelloWorld:** The classic "Hello, World!" program to get you started.
- **Variables and Data Types:** Examples showcasing the use of variables and different data types in Java.
- **Control Flow:** Code snippets demonstrating if statements, loops, and switch statements.
- **Functions and Methods:** Understanding the basics of functions and methods in Java.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute by adding your own code or improvements.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

This section will be populated with implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java. Once I've covered the basics, I'll start working on DSA to enhance problem-solving skills.

- **LinkedLists:** Java implementations of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Arrays:** Examples of array manipulation and algorithms.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Java implementations of popular sorting algorithms.

Check back later as this section evolves with more advanced topics.
